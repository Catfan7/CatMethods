Instructions:
  Choose the file of the programming language you intend to use it for. For example, if you're going to use it for Python, choose the .py file.
  Download the file and put it in the same directory as your Main file (or whatever you're going to use it for)
  Now you have a bunch of new toys to play with
  
  
Usage:
  
  Java:
    When you are in in your file or class that you are going to code in, and you want to use a catmethods method, type: catmethods.(and then the method you want to access)
  
  Python:
    When you are in in your file or class that you are going to code in, and you want to use a catmethods method, type: catmethods.(and then the method you want to access)
    
  C#:
    When you are in in your file or class that you are going to code in, and you want to use a catmethods method, type: catmethods.(and then the method you want to access)
    
  C or C++:
    When you are in in your file or class that you are going to code in, put #include "catmethods.h" at the beginning. Then you can just type the name of the function you want to access and there you go
    
  R:
    Litterally nothing all you have to do is type the name of the function when you want to use it
    
  Go:
    Same as R
